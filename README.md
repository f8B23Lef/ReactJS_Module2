# Home task (Task 1)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Create a git repository on Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket or any other platform. Discuss with your mentor which platform is better.
Use [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) to bootstrap a new app. Commit the changes to repository. Install extensions mentioned in the lecture ([react developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en), etc.).

## Create components

Switch to a new branch. Create several components using:

1.  React.createElement
2.  React.Component
3.  React.PureComponent
4.  Functional component

To understand more how components work it's recommended to create a couple of interactive components, for example:

- A counter, which renders a numeric value and two buttons to increment or decrement the value.
- A search form as per the design guide, which renders a search input and a button to initiate a new search action.
- A genre toggle as per the design guide.

### `npm start`
